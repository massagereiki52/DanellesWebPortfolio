          <P>
          As an artist, I find inspiration in the day to day, but my biggest inspiration for my work is my faith. I try to incorporate at least a little bit of it into everything that I do. It may not be outwardly there in the finished projects. However, that is what gives me my drive to create the most real and authentically creative work. My designs aren’t only inventive, complex, and inspirational, but they are also deep and have great meaning to the world.
          </P>
          <P>
          To me, there is nothing better than the smell of freshly opened paint.  The brushes and the art materials in my hands while they dance across the canvas or page. I love the complexity of coding an elegant website.  The process of photography from finding a beautiful spot and setting up the shot, to the behind the scenes editing of the photos to make them the best that they can be.  </P>
          <P>
          I have been writing for over 22 years. I have a blog called, “My Walk of Bold Faith,” which is a faith-based blog of inspirational poetry, quotes, stories, and real-life examples of what God can do in our lives. I not only have experience in blogging, but I have also written content for various websites, including content for my sites. My varied experiences with Wix, WordPress, and regular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as some experience with PHP and content writing, will help, you, the client to have a great user experience and the features in which will help you to portray your business, ministry, or church in the manner in which you desire to be portrayed. </P>
