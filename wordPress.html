          <p>The project designed for Singer/Songwriter and Minister Cody James was created to help to inform others of Cody's music and Prison Ministry while assisting him to bring his testimony, music, and the word of God to the World. In this
          project, the goal was to revamp the original website completely. The client didn't like various aspects of the original site, and the goals were to find a different way to show his upcoming events, fix the readability and the overall look
          of the website for both mobile and desktop. As you can see from the screenshots, the website has drastically changed. I updated the menu, changed the font thinned out some of the text, and changed various other aspects of the site,
          including removing the calendar and making it more user-friendly for the client â€” this website created on Wix which, is a template-based web platform.</p>
