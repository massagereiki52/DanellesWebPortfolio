            <!-- EpilepsyShop brief -->
            <p>Epilepsy Shop is a woo-commerce website that I created with WordPress using various plug-ins. The goal of this site is to bring awareness about Epilepsy and eventually help to support our local Epilepsy Foundation. It was created in my Web II class;
              all items in the shop part of the site are designed and branded by me.</p>
          </a>


            <p>I designed and updated the Cody James Ministry website. The main goal of this project was to strategize a design plan and to reorganize, redesign, and increase user accessibility and readability, using the template-based
              web platform Wix. The outcome of this project was a visually pleasing and more comfortable site to navigate.

            <p>Little Pond is a WordPress website created using various plug-ins such as; Contact Form 7, Elementor, and Google Analytics and a plug-in that I created using PHP that helps to give the viewer the date and time. The main goal of this
              project was to break down and organize the provided content to create a visually pleasing and easily navigated site. The outcome of this project was an organized and productive website. </p>

            <p>The Factory indoor BMX park website is a WordPress site that I created as a final for my Web 2 class. The main goal is to highlight what the business has to offer and create a waiver form using Contact Form 7 making it more
              convenient for their customers. I utilized various plug-ins: Google Analytics, MetaSlider, as well as Social Media and Share Icons and customized the CSS to fit the specifications of the assignment. </p>
