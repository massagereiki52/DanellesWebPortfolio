            Light Room is a simple page in which HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript were used to create a slideshow. Just click on one of the thumbnails to bring the slideshow into view. The first two assets created in illustrator and the photograph was
            taken with my Nikon D5600 camera and edited in lightroom and photoshop. There are many uses for this template; welcome page, an events page, as a photo gallery for an artist, or a portfolio page. The versatility of such a page would make
            it appropriate for just about anyone looking for a slideshow.

          <p>
            In this project, I had to take HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create a working application that tells the time of day, weather type, and wind speed. All of the assets for this project designed with both Illustrator and Piskel. The
            background image was photographed by me and was edited in Lightroom and Photoshop to help to enhance the look of the image's features. I used Google Fonts for the text of the title. The App will help anyone to find out the weather in
            their area.

          <p>
            The goal in the project Electric Dreams was to make the computer talk to you. Through the use of HTLM5, CSS3, and JavaScript, I was able to create an interactive communication between the user and their equipment. The robot was created in
            Piskel to give the illusion that the user is talking to their computer. It would be a fun add on to any website and could enhance the user experience by adding an interactive component to any welcome page.

            The relationship website was one of the very first sites that I created in my Web 1 class. It is a simple HTML5 and CSS3 site about my relationship with my husband. I chose this site to show how my skills have progressed as a web
            designer. The page would make for an excellent template for any about page.
